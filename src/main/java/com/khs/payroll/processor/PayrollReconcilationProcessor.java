//6. Error Handling and Recovery
//Error logging: Log errors encountered during the ACH file processing to facilitate debugging and reconciliation.
//Invalid transactions: If there are any invalid payments (e.g., incorrect account numbers, insufficient funds), those should be handled separately, possibly using a pending or retry mechanism.
//Reconciliation process: After processing the ACH file, you’ll need a mechanism to reconcile the bank’s transactions with the ACH records to ensure accuracy.
//7. Audit and Compliance
//Ensure that your application complies with regulatory standards, including NACHA rules and other banking regulations (KYC, AML, etc.).
//Implement auditing functionality to track every step of the ACH payment processing for compliance and traceability.
//8. Monitoring and Reporting
//Set up logging for ACH file processing, including details of each transaction, success/failure status, and other key metrics.
//Build reporting tools to generate summaries of payroll transactions received and processed, as well as any errors or discrepancies.
