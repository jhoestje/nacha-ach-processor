//2. validation
//Transaction validation: Verify that each payment detail (e.g., employee bank account number, routing number, amount) is valid.
//Employee information: Match the payroll payment details to the corresponding account information stored within your bank’s system.

//3. Transaction Management
//Leverage Spring’s transactional support (@Transactional) to ensure that the process of transferring funds is atomic. If a failure occurs at any point, the entire transaction should roll back.
//If your system handles payments in batches, make sure each batch is processed completely or not at all, in case of failures.
//Implement retry mechanisms or compensating transactions if something fails during processing.
//4. Fund Transfer Mechanism
//Once you've validated the ACH file and employee account details, initiate the transfer of funds from the business’s payroll account to the employee accounts.
//Integrate with your bank's internal systems for fund transfers:
//Internal bank APIs: This might involve using APIs provided by the bank’s internal systems to move money between accounts.
//Ledger updates: Ensure that the bank's ledger is updated accordingly to reflect the changes.
//Ensure that the logic supports real-time fund settlement, and that transfers are executed efficiently.
